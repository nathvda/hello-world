# hello-world
Welcome to my repository. My name is Nathalie and I am trying out stuff to learn more about MarkDown.

To help you, here is a little **Table of content**. 
## Table of Content.
1. [banana](#Solaris)
    1. We have more things to add here. 
        1. Another list over here. Or should I say, a sublist.

# This is a main title, if you really want to know about it.
To introduce myself, maybe I should write a little bit of background. As you may notice, I love learning. 
[^2]

[^2]: Spoiler, she has no idea what she is doing right now, but she's trying to use the footnotes, so here we go again.

## Houhou Again

### Houhou even more

#### Again.

> I will now quote something.

We try again because this is a quote. 
 > # We can even quote a title ! 

 > *And* if we want to write something that's bold We can do this.

 Don't pay attention to the unusual amount of horizontal rules, but she was trying to use them and there were a lot of them.

## Now, onto some lists.

First, let's try to use unordered lists
[^3]

[^3]: By definition, these have... Well, they have no order, that's why they're unordered. Anyway, don't focus on reading these. 

- a list
- another list
- yet another list

1. Locomotor mortis
2. Tarentallegra
3. Occulus reparo

-  List
    - Second list  
        - Third list

* Doo Doo
+ Daa Daa
